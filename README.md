# Non-linear-regression-of-phase-velocity-data
Approximating the average phase velocity of ambient noise signals is one of the important steps in passive seismic imaging.
When we have many phase velocity data in terms of period for station pairs, we can estimate the average dispersion curve by non-linear regression of the data. An exampe of this estimation is shown in the following figure:
